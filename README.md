I'm ely and I'm crafting digital, physical & experiential solutions with design processes, static generators, computational/generative tech and an ever-growing blend of creative + technical skill sets learned and applied to best fit the challenge/opportunity ahead.

My code implementations, open-source work and experiments on the dev side are mostly hosted here on Github and/or on Netlify & I'll be blogging on mostly-related topics on [ely.io](https://ely.io).
